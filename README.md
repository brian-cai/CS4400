# CS4400
## Database
Implementation of a "Mold and Air Quality" database for CS4400.

Rehosted for demo purposes 7/31/2018.

## Navigation
Old_Copy Folder was what was the in the original final repository

EER Diagrams --- /Old_Copy/Phase 1/phase 1 complete.pdf

Relational Schemes --- /Old_Copy/Phase 2/CS4400_Group37_Phase2.pdf

SQL Statements --- /Old_Copy/Phase3_Final/Phase 3 SQL/FINALSQL.sql

## Setup
Server --- original cc.gatech.edu, now using freemysqlhosting.net

Demo --- originally localhost on a vm, now using heroku

Some pages were modified and some js was changed due to heroku's environment being very different from a localhost.

## Running Locally
To run locally, you need php and mysqli. Install them.

I did it with linux on a virtual machine (virtualbox) on ubuntu. Use sudo apt-get and all that.

Starting the server: php -S localhost:8000 (or whatever port)

To view, open chrome and go to localhost:8000 (or whatever port)
